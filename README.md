# Cruise_Logs
Field Ops database and entry forms

For each form, edit the DB_PATH at the top to reflect where the DB was copied to,
in my case: 

DB_PATH = os.path.expanduser("~/Apps/databases/Cruise_Logs.db")


Tip for deployment form - there is a sidebar for Nylon and Releases, closed by default.
There is a double arrow symbol in the top left, click to open sidebar.
